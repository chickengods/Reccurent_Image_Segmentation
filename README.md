# Reccurent_Image_Segmentation

After reading through Distill's [Thread: Differentiable Self-organizing Systems](https://distill.pub/2020/selforg/) and [Image Segmentation via Cellulat Automata](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04965.pdf) I wanted to implement a Celluar Automata Image Segmentation algorithm, with the ulitmate goal of segmenting videos.
